Welcome to my new site. I've decided to try my hand at blogging from time to,
so if you're interested here's where you'll find my posts.

I would like to extend a very large thank-you to Harry Roberts of [CSS
Wizardry](http://csswizardry.com). Without [Inuit
CSS](http://csswizardry.com/inuitcss/), his amazing CSS framework, this site
would not have turn out nearly as pretty as it did :)

And for now I leave you to continue wandering the Interwebs.

Come back soon!!!
