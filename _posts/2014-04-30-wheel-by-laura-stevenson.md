On [Wheel](http://open.spotify.com/album/6T2PF0oGrBg2Ps8CnQS5x5) by [Laura Stevenson](http://www.laurastevenson.net/) you'll find a wonderful bunch of really personal songs. The feels, man... I like it a lot.

If you're into it, I recommend some of her older stuff as well. I'm particularly fond of [Sit Resist](http://open.spotify.com/album/0rFAh4tw0E0l8N9xmx20TL).

I've decided to start posting something good to listen to every week or two. I've been into albums lately so I figured I would share.
