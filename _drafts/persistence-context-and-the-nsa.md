The recent NSA leaks by whistleblower Edward Snowden have raised quite a bit of interesting and I think beneficial debate on privacy and government surveillance of phone and Internet information. In defending the NSA's surveillance programs, President Obama has strongly emphasized that the programs are *only* used on foreigners. I've been wondering, given the inherently multinational nature of services like Facebook and Google, is surveilling foreign users ok?
